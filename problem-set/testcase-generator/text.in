 Next Previous Contents Setting up a contest

After installation is successful, you want to run your contest! Configuring DOMjudge to run a contest (or a number of them, in sequence) involves the following steps:

    Configure the contest data;
    Set up authentication for teams;
    Supply in- and output testdata;
    Check that everything works.

4.1 Configure the contest data

DOMjudge stores and retrieves most of its data from the MySQL database. Some information must be filled in beforehand, other tables will be populated by DOMjudge.

You can use the jury web interface to add, edit and delete most types of data described below. It's advised to keep a version of phpMyAdmin handy in case of emergencies, or for general database operations like import and export.

This section describes the meaning of each table and what you need to put into it. Tables marked with an `x' are the ones you have to configure with contest data before running a contest (via the jury web interface or e.g. with phpMyAdmin), the other tables are used automatically by the software:
	auditlog 	Log of every state-changing event.
	balloon 	Balloons to be handed out.
	clarification 	Clarification requests/replies are stored here.
x	configuration 	Runtime configuration settings.
x	contest 	Contest definitions with start/end time.
x	contestproblem 	Coupling of problems to contests and data specific to it.
x	contestteam 	Coupling of teams to contests.
	event 	Log of events during contests.
x	executable 	Executable compile/run/compare scripts.
	judgehost 	Computers (hostnames) that function as judgehosts.
x	judgehost_restriction	Optional restriction sets on submissions taken by judgehosts.
	judging 	Judgings of submissions.
	judging_run 	Result of one testcase within a judging.
x	language 	Definition of allowed submission languages.
x	problem 	Definition of problems (name, timelimit, etc.).
	rankcache_jury 	Cache of team ranking data for public/teams and for the jury
	rankcache_public	separately, because of possibility of score freezing.
	rejudging 	Metadata for batched rejudging.
	role 	Possible user roles.
	scorecache_jury 	Cache of the scoreboards for public/teams and for the jury
	scorecache_public	separately, because of possibility of score freezing.
	submission 	Submission metadata of solutions to problems.
	submission_file 	Submitted code files.
x	team 	Definition of teams.
x	team_affiliation 	Definition of institutions a team can be affiliated with.
x	team_category 	Different category groups teams can be put in.
	team_unread 	Records which clarifications are read by which team.
x	testcase 	Definition of testdata for each problem.
x	user 	Users that will able to access the system.
x	userrole 	Mapping of users to their roles.

Now follows a longer description (including fields) per table that has to be filled manually. As a general remark: almost all tables have an identifier field. Most of these are numeric and automatically increasing; these do not need to be specified. The tables executable and language have text strings as identifier fields. These need to be manually specified and only alpha-numeric, dash and underscore characters are valid, i.e. a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _.

configuration

    This table contains configuration settings. These entries are simply stored as name, value pairs, where the values are JSON encoded, type contains the allowed data type, and description documents the configuration setting.
contest

    The contests that the software will run. E.g. a test session and the live contest.

    cid is the reference ID and contestname is a descriptive name used in the interface, while shortname is the publicly visible identifier.

    activatetime, starttime and endtime are required fields and specify when this contest is active and open for submissions. Optional freezetime and unfreezetime control scoreboard freezing and deactivatetime when the contest is not visible anymore. For a detailed treating of these, see section Contest milestones. All contest times can be specified relative to starttime, except of course starttime itself. The input given in the jury interface (either relative or absolute) is stored in the *time_string fields, while a calculated absolute version is stored in the fields without the _string suffix.

    The public field can be used to limit which contests are displayed as public scoreboards (as opposed to privately to a selected set of teams), while enabled can be used to (temporarily) disable a contest altogether.
contestproblem

    This table couples problems to contests: cid and probid describe the pairing.

    Furthermore, it stores problem data that is specific for the included contest: shortname is a contest-unique identifier string for the problem, points defaults to 1 and can be set to assign non-even scoring; allow_submit determines whether teams can submit solutions for this problem. Non-submittable problems are also not displayed on the scoreboard. This can be used to define spare problems, which can then be added to the contest quickly; allow_judge determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. See also the explanation for language.

    The color tag can be filled with a CSS colour specification to associate with this problem; see also section Scoreboard: colours.
contestteam

    This table couples teams to contests. Teams can only submit solutions to problems in contests that are public or which they are part of.
executable

    This table stores zip-bundles of executable scripts that can be used as compile, run, and compare scripts.
judgehost_restriction

    This table encodes restriction sets for selecting which submissions are sent to a judgehost. The restrictions are JSON encoded in the restrictions column, and can be set in the admin web interface to restrict on specific contests, problems, languages, and to never rejudge on the same judgehost. A restriction set can be assigned to judgehost(s) on the edit page of the judgehosts overview.
language

    Programming languages in which to accept and judge submissions. langid is a string of maximum length 8, which references the language. name is the displayed name of the language; extensions is a JSON encoded list of recognized filename extensions; allow_submit determines whether teams can submit using this language; allow_judge determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. This can for example be set to no to temporarily hold judging when a problem occurs with the judging of a specific language; after resolution of the problem this can be set to yes again.

    time_factor is the relative factor by which the timelimit is multiplied for solutions in this language; compile_script refers to a compile executable script that is used for this language.
problem

    This table contains the problem definitions. probid is the reference ID, cid is the contest ID this problem is (only) defined for: a problem cannot be used in multiple contests. name is the full name (description) of the problem.

    allow_submit determines whether teams can submit solutions for this problem. Non-submittable problems are also not displayed on the scoreboard. This can be used to define spare problems, which can then be added to the contest quickly; allow_judge determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. See also the explanation for language.

    timelimit is the timelimit in seconds within which solutions for this problem have to run (taking into account time_factor per language). See also enforcement of time limits for more details.

    memlimit is the memory limit in kB allotted for this problem. If empty then the global configuration setting memory_limit is used. Equivalently for outputlimit.

    special_run if not empty defines a custom run program run_<special_run> to run compiled submissions for this problem and special_compare if not empty defines a custom compare program compare_<special_compare> to compare output for this problem.

    The color tag can be filled with a CSS colour specification to associate with this problem; see also section Scoreboard: colours.

    In problemtext a PDF, HTML or plain text document can be placed which allows team, public and jury to download the problem statement. Note that no additional filtering takes place, so HTML (and PDF to some extent) should be from a trusted source to prevent cross site scripting or other attacks. The file type is stored in problemtext_type.
team

    Table of teams: teamid is (internal) ID of the team, while externalid can be used to store an ID for im/exporting to other systems. name the displayed name of the team, categoryid is the ID of the category the team is in; affilid is the affiliation ID of the team.

    When enabled is set to 0, the team immediately disappears from the scoreboards and cannot use the team web interface anymore, even when already logged in. One use case could be to disqualify a team on the spot.

    members are the names of the team members, separated by newlines and room is the location or room of the team, both for display only; comments can be filled with arbitrary useful information and is only visible to the jury. The timestamp teampage_first_visited and the hostname field indicate when/whether/from where a team visited its team web interface.

    The penalty field can be used to give this team a (positive or negative) number of penalty minutes to correct for exceptional circumstances.
team_affiliation

    affilid is the reference ID and name the name of the institution. country should be the 3 character ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 abbreviation of the country and comments is a free form field that is displayed in the jury interface.

    A country flag can be displayed on the scoreboard. For this to work, the country field must match a (flag) picture in www/images/countries/<country>.png. All country flags are present there, named with their 3-character ISO codes. See also www/images/countries/README.
team_category

    categoryid is the reference ID and name is a string: the name of the category. sortorder is the order at which this group must be sorted in the scoreboard, where a higher number sorts lower and equal sort depending on score.

    The color is again a CSS colour specification used to discern different categories easily. See also section Scoreboard: colours.

    The visible flag determines whether teams in this category are displayed on the public/team scoreboard. This feature can be used to remove teams from the public scoreboard by assigning them to a separate, invisible category.
testcase

    The testcase table contains testdata for each problem; testcaseid is a unique identifier, input and output contain the testcase input/output and image an optional graphical representation of the testcase for the jury. The fields md5sum_input, md5sum_output, and md5sum_image contain their respective md5 hashes to check for up-to-date-ness of cached versions by the judgehosts and image_thumb and image_type a thumbnail version and mimetype string for the image. The field probid is the corresponding problem and rank determines the order of the testcases for one problem. description is an optional description for this testcase. See also providing testdata.
user

    This table has the users that the system knows about with their login credentials. Each user may have one or more roles, like being part of a team, being a jury member or administrator. There are also functional accounts, like for judgedaemons.

4.2 Contest milestones

The contest table specifies timestamps for each contest that mark specific milestones in the course of the contest.

The triplet activatetime, starttime and endtime define when the contest runs and are required fields (activatetime and starttime may be equal).

activatetime is the moment when a contest first becomes visible to the public and teams . Nothing can be submitted yet and the problem set is not revealed. Clarifications can be viewed and sent.

At starttime, the scoreboard is displayed and submissions are accepted. At endtime the contest stops. New incoming submissions will still be processed and judged, but the result will not be shown anymore to teams; they instead receive the verdict`too-late'. Unjudged submissions received before endtime will still be judged normally.

freezetime and unfreezetime control scoreboard freezing. freezetime is the time after which the public and team scoreboard are not updated anymore (frozen). This is meant to make the last stages of the contest more thrilling, because no-one knows who has won. Leaving them empty disables this feature. When using this feature, unfreezetime can be set to automatically `unfreeze' the scoreboard at that time. For a more elaborate description, see also section Scoreboard: freezing and defrosting.

The scoreboard, results and clarifications will remain to be displayed to team and public after a contest, until the deactivatetime.

All events happen at the first moment of the defined time. That is: for a contest with starttime "12:00:00" and endtime "17:00:00", the first submission will be accepted at 12:00:00 and the last one at 16:59:59.

The following ordering must always hold: activatetime <= starttime < (freezetime <=) endtime (<= unfreezetime) (<= deactivatime).
4.3 User authentication

The authentication system lets the domserver know which user it is dealing with and which role(s) the user has. This system is modular, allowing flexible addition of new methods, if required. The following methods are available by default for authentication.
PHP session with passwords (default)

Each user receives a password and PHP's session management is used to keep track of which user is logged in. This method is easiest to setup. It does require the administrator to generate users and passwords for all teams (this can be done in the jury interface) and distribute those, though. Also, each team has to login each time they (re)start their browser. The password is stored in a salted MD5 hash in the password field in database (user table).
IP-address based

The IP-address of a team's workstation is used as the primary means of authentication. The system assumes that someone coming from a specific IP is the user with that IP listed in the user table. When a team browses to the web interface, this is checked and the appropriate team page is presented.

This method has the advantage that teams do not have to login. A requirement for this method is that each team computer has a separate IP-address from the view of the domserver, though, so this is most suitable for onsite contests and might not work with online contests if multiple teams are located behind a router, for example.

There are two possible ways of configuring team IP-addresses.
Supply it beforehand

Before the contest starts, when entering teams into the database, add the IP that each team will have to that user's entry in the ip_address field. When the teams arrive, everything will work directly and without further configuration (except when teams switch workplaces). If possible, this is the recommended modus operandi, because it's the least hassle just before and during the contest.
Use one-time passwords

Supply the teams with a one time username and password with which to authenticate. Beforehand, generate passwords for each team in the jury interface. When the test session (or contest) starts and a team connects to the web interface and have an unknown IP, they will be prompted for username and password. Once supplied, the IP is stored and the password is removed and not needed anymore the next time.

This is also a secure option, but requires a bit more hassle from the teams, and maybe from the organisers who have to distribute pieces of paper.

Note: the web interface will only allow a team to authenticate themselves once. If an IP is set, a next authentication will be refused (to avoid trouble with lingering passwords). In order to fully re-authenticate a team, the IP address needs to be unset. You might also want to generate a new password for this specific user. Furthermore, a team must explicitly connect to the team interface URL, because with an unknown IP, the root DOMjudge website will redirect to the public interface.
Using an external LDAP server

This method can be useful when you want to integrate DOMjudge into a larger system, or already have credentials on an LDAP server available. The username field in the database must contain the LDAP username of the DOMjudge user. Furthermore, in etc/domserver-config.php the LDAP_* configuration settings must be adapted to your setup. Note that multiple (backup) servers can be specified: they are queried in order to try to successfully authenticate. After successful authentication against the LDAP server(s), PHP sessions are used to track login into DOMjudge.
Fixed authentication

This method automatically authenticates each connection to the web interface as a fixed, configurable user. This can be useful for testing or demonstration purposes, but probably not for real use scenarios.
Adding new authentication methods

The authentication system is modular and adding new authentication methods is fairly easy. The authentication is handled in the file lib/www/auth.php. Adding a new method amounts to editing the functions in that file to handle your specific case.
4.4 Providing testdata

Testdata is used to judge the problems: when a submission run is given the input testdata, the resulting output is compared to the reference output data using a compare script. The default compare script simply checks if the outputs are equal up to whitespace differences, but more elaborate comparisons can be done, see e.g. the float and boolfind_cmp scripts.

The database has a separate table named testcase, which can be manipulated from the web interface. Under a problem, click on the testcase link. There the files can be uploaded. The judgehosts cache a copy based on MD5 sum, so if you need to make changes later, re-upload the data in the web interface and it will automatically be picked up.

Testdata can also be imported into the system from a problem zip file, following the Kattis problem package format.
4.5 Start the daemons

Once everything is configured, you can start the daemons. They all run as a normal user on the system. The needed root privileges are gained through sudo only when necessary.

    One or more judgedaemons: one on each judgehost (or optionally multiple per host, if cgroups are enabled; then the -n X option should be used to bind a judgedaemon to CPU X to prevent CPU resource conflicts).
    Optionally the balloon notification daemon (as an alternative to the web interface).

4.6 Check that everything works

If the daemons have started without any problems, you've come a long way! Now to check that you're ready for a contest.

First, go to the jury interface: http(s)://yourhost.example.edu/domjudge/jury. Look under all the menu items to see whether the displayed data looks sane. Use the config-checker under `Admin Functions' for some sanity checks on your configuration.

Go to a team workstation and see if you can access the team page and if you can submit solutions.

Next, it is time to submit some test solutions. If you have the default Hello World problem enabled, you can submit some of the example sources from under the doc/examples directory. They should give `CORRECT'.

You can also try some (or all) of the sources under tests. Use make check to submit a variety of tests; this should work when the submit client is available and the default example problems are in the active contest. There's also make stress-test, but be warned that these tests might crash a judgedaemon. The results can be checked in the web interface; each source file specifies the expected outcome with some explanations. For convenience, there is a link judging verifier in the admin web interface; this will automatically check whether submitted sources from the tests directory were judged as expected. Note that a few sources have multiple possible outcomes: these must be verified manually.

When all this worked, you're quite ready for a contest. Or at least, the practice session of a contest.
4.7 Testing jury solutions

Before running a real contest, you and/or the jury will want to test the jury's reference solutions on the system.

The simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a problem zip file and upload this. You can also upload a zip file containing just solutions to an existing problem. Note that the zip archive has to adhere to the Kattis problem package format. For this to work, the jury/admin who uploads the problem has to have an associated team to which the solutions will be assigned. The solutions will automatically be judged if the contest is active (but it need not have started yet). You can verify whether the submissions gave the expected answer from the link on the jury/admin index page.

1. DOMjudge overview

DOMjudge is a system for running programming contests, like the ACM ICPC regional and world championship programming contests.

This means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly 5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 8-11). Problems are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed languages, that reads input according to the problem input specification and writes the correct, corresponding output.

The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to the jury. There the jury system automatically compiles and runs the program and compares the program output with the expected output.

This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during such contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication on problems (clarification requests). It has web interfaces for the jury, the teams (their submissions and clarification requests) and the public (scoreboard).
1.1 Features

A global overview of the features that DOMjudge provides:

    Automatic judging with distributed (scalable) judge hosts
    Web interface for portability and simplicity
    Modular system for plugging in languages/compilers and validators
    Detailed jury information (submissions, judgings, diffs) and options (rejudge, clarifications, resubmit)
    Designed with security in mind
    Has been used in many live contests
    Open Source, Free Software

About the name and logo

The name of this judging system is inspired by a very important and well known landmark in the city of Utrecht: the dome tower, called the `Dom' in Dutch. The logo of the 2004 Dutch Programming Championships (for which this system was originally developed) depicts a representation of the Dom in zeros and ones. We based the name and logo of DOMjudge on that.

We would like to thank Erik van Sebille, the original creator of the logo. The logo is under a GPL licence, although Erik first suggested a "free as in beer" licence first: you're allowed to use it, but you owe Erik a free beer in case might you encounter him.
1.3 Contact

The DOMjudge homepage can be found at: https://www.domjudge.org/

We have a low volume mailing list for announcements of new releases.

The authors can be reached through the development mailing list: domjudge-devel@domjudge.org. You need to be subscribed before you can post. See the list information page for subscription and more details.

3. Before the contest

Before the contest starts, a number of things will need to be configured by the administrator. You can check that information, such as the problem set(s), test data and time limits, contest start- and end time, the time at which the scoreboard will be frozen and unfrozen, all from the links from the front page.

Note that multiple contests can be defined, with corresponding problem sets, for example a practice session and the real contest.
3.1 Problems and languages

The problem sets are listed under `Problems'. It is possible to change whether teams can submit solutions for that problem (using the toggle switch `allow submit'). If disallowed, submissions for that problem will be rejected, but more importantly, teams will not see that problem on the scoreboard. Disallow judge will make DOMjudge accept submissions, but leave them queued; this is useful in case an unexpected problem shows up with one of the problems. Timelimit is the maximum number of seconds a submission for this problem is allowed to run before a `TIMELIMIT' response is given (to be multiplied possibly by a language factor). Note that a `timelimit overshoot' can be configured to let submissions run a bit longer. Although DOMjudge will use the actual limit to determine the verdict, this allows judges to see if a submission is close to the timelimit.

Problems can be imported and exported into and from DOMjudge using zip-files that contain the problem metadata and testdata files, based on the problemarchive.org format. See appendix Problem package format -specification for details. Problems can have special compare and run scripts associated to them, to deal with problem statements that require non-standard evaluation. For more details see the administrator's manual.

The `Languages' overview is quite the same. It has a timefactor column; submissions in a language that has time factor 2 will be allowed to run twice the time that has been specified under Problems. This can be used to compensate for the execution speed of a language, e.g. Java.
3.2 Verifying testdata

For checking whether the your testdata conforms to the specifications of your problem statement, we recommend the checktestdata program, which is available from a separate repository. It allows you to not only check on simple (spacing) layout errors, but a simple grammar file must be specified for the testdata, according to which the testdata is checked. This allows e.g. for bounds checking.

This program is built upon the separate library libchecktestdata.h that can be used to write the syntax checking part of special compare scripts: it can easily handle the tedious task of verifying that a team's submission output is syntactically valid, leaving just the task of semantic validation to another program.
3.3 Testing jury solutions

Before a contest, you will want to have tested your reference solutions on the system to see whether those are judged as expected and maybe use their runtimes to set timelimits for the problems.

The simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a problem zip file and upload this. You can also upload a zip file containing just solutions to an existing problem. Note that the zip archive has to adhere to the Kattis problem package format. For this to work, the jury/admin who uploads the problem has to have an associated team to which the solutions will be assigned. The solutions will automatically be judged if the contest is active (but it need not have started yet). You can verify whether the submissions gave the expected answer from the link on the jury/admin index page.
3.4 Practice Session

If your contest has a test session or practice contest, use it also as a general rehearsal of the jury system: judge test submissions as you would do during the real contest and answer incoming clarification requests.

Next Previous Contents Setting up a contest

After installation is successful, you want to run your contest! Configuring DOMjudge to run a contest (or a number of them, in sequence) involves the following steps:

    Configure the contest data;
    Set up authentication for teams;
    Supply in- and output testdata;
    Check that everything works.

4.1 Configure the contest data

DOMjudge stores and retrieves most of its data from the MySQL database. Some information must be filled in beforehand, other tables will be populated by DOMjudge.

You can use the jury web interface to add, edit and delete most types of data described below. It's advised to keep a version of phpMyAdmin handy in case of emergencies, or for general database operations like import and export.

This section describes the meaning of each table and what you need to put into it. Tables marked with an `x' are the ones you have to configure with contest data before running a contest (via the jury web interface or e.g. with phpMyAdmin), the other tables are used automatically by the software:
	auditlog 	Log of every state-changing event.
	balloon 	Balloons to be handed out.
	clarification 	Clarification requests/replies are stored here.
x	configuration 	Runtime configuration settings.
x	contest 	Contest definitions with start/end time.
x	contestproblem 	Coupling of problems to contests and data specific to it.
x	contestteam 	Coupling of teams to contests.
	event 	Log of events during contests.
x	executable 	Executable compile/run/compare scripts.
	judgehost 	Computers (hostnames) that function as judgehosts.
x	judgehost_restriction	Optional restriction sets on submissions taken by judgehosts.
	judging 	Judgings of submissions.
	judging_run 	Result of one testcase within a judging.
x	language 	Definition of allowed submission languages.
x	problem 	Definition of problems (name, timelimit, etc.).
	rankcache_jury 	Cache of team ranking data for public/teams and for the jury
	rankcache_public	separately, because of possibility of score freezing.
	rejudging 	Metadata for batched rejudging.
	role 	Possible user roles.
	scorecache_jury 	Cache of the scoreboards for public/teams and for the jury
	scorecache_public	separately, because of possibility of score freezing.
	submission 	Submission metadata of solutions to problems.
	submission_file 	Submitted code files.
x	team 	Definition of teams.
x	team_affiliation 	Definition of institutions a team can be affiliated with.
x	team_category 	Different category groups teams can be put in.
	team_unread 	Records which clarifications are read by which team.
x	testcase 	Definition of testdata for each problem.
x	user 	Users that will able to access the system.
x	userrole 	Mapping of users to their roles.

Now follows a longer description (including fields) per table that has to be filled manually. As a general remark: almost all tables have an identifier field. Most of these are numeric and automatically increasing; these do not need to be specified. The tables executable and language have text strings as identifier fields. These need to be manually specified and only alpha-numeric, dash and underscore characters are valid, i.e. a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _.

configuration

    This table contains configuration settings. These entries are simply stored as name, value pairs, where the values are JSON encoded, type contains the allowed data type, and description documents the configuration setting.
contest

    The contests that the software will run. E.g. a test session and the live contest.

    cid is the reference ID and contestname is a descriptive name used in the interface, while shortname is the publicly visible identifier.

    activatetime, starttime and endtime are required fields and specify when this contest is active and open for submissions. Optional freezetime and unfreezetime control scoreboard freezing and deactivatetime when the contest is not visible anymore. For a detailed treating of these, see section Contest milestones. All contest times can be specified relative to starttime, except of course starttime itself. The input given in the jury interface (either relative or absolute) is stored in the *time_string fields, while a calculated absolute version is stored in the fields without the _string suffix.

    The public field can be used to limit which contests are displayed as public scoreboards (as opposed to privately to a selected set of teams), while enabled can be used to (temporarily) disable a contest altogether.
contestproblem

    This table couples problems to contests: cid and probid describe the pairing.

    Furthermore, it stores problem data that is specific for the included contest: shortname is a contest-unique identifier string for the problem, points defaults to 1 and can be set to assign non-even scoring; allow_submit determines whether teams can submit solutions for this problem. Non-submittable problems are also not displayed on the scoreboard. This can be used to define spare problems, which can then be added to the contest quickly; allow_judge determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. See also the explanation for language.

    The color tag can be filled with a CSS colour specification to associate with this problem; see also section Scoreboard: colours.
contestteam

    This table couples teams to contests. Teams can only submit solutions to problems in contests that are public or which they are part of.
executable

    This table stores zip-bundles of executable scripts that can be used as compile, run, and compare scripts.
judgehost_restriction

    This table encodes restriction sets for selecting which submissions are sent to a judgehost. The restrictions are JSON encoded in the restrictions column, and can be set in the admin web interface to restrict on specific contests, problems, languages, and to never rejudge on the same judgehost. A restriction set can be assigned to judgehost(s) on the edit page of the judgehosts overview.
language

    Programming languages in which to accept and judge submissions. langid is a string of maximum length 8, which references the language. name is the displayed name of the language; extensions is a JSON encoded list of recognized filename extensions; allow_submit determines whether teams can submit using this language; allow_judge determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. This can for example be set to no to temporarily hold judging when a problem occurs with the judging of a specific language; after resolution of the problem this can be set to yes again.

    time_factor is the relative factor by which the timelimit is multiplied for solutions in this language; compile_script refers to a compile executable script that is used for this language.
problem

    This table contains the problem definitions. probid is the reference ID, cid is the contest ID this problem is (only) defined for: a problem cannot be used in multiple contests. name is the full name (description) of the problem.

    allow_submit determines whether teams can submit solutions for this problem. Non-submittable problems are also not displayed on the scoreboard. This can be used to define spare problems, which can then be added to the contest quickly; allow_judge determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. See also the explanation for language.

    timelimit is the timelimit in seconds within which solutions for this problem have to run (taking into account time_factor per language). See also enforcement of time limits for more details.

    memlimit is the memory limit in kB allotted for this problem. If empty then the global configuration setting memory_limit is used. Equivalently for outputlimit.

    special_run if not empty defines a custom run program run_<special_run> to run compiled submissions for this problem and special_compare if not empty defines a custom compare program compare_<special_compare> to compare output for this problem.

    The color tag can be filled with a CSS colour specification to associate with this problem; see also section Scoreboard: colours.

    In problemtext a PDF, HTML or plain text document can be placed which allows team, public and jury to download the problem statement. Note that no additional filtering takes place, so HTML (and PDF to some extent) should be from a trusted source to prevent cross site scripting or other attacks. The file type is stored in problemtext_type.
team

    Table of teams: teamid is (internal) ID of the team, while externalid can be used to store an ID for im/exporting to other systems. name the displayed name of the team, categoryid is the ID of the category the team is in; affilid is the affiliation ID of the team.

    When enabled is set to 0, the team immediately disappears from the scoreboards and cannot use the team web interface anymore, even when already logged in. One use case could be to disqualify a team on the spot.

    members are the names of the team members, separated by newlines and room is the location or room of the team, both for display only; comments can be filled with arbitrary useful information and is only visible to the jury. The timestamp teampage_first_visited and the hostname field indicate when/whether/from where a team visited its team web interface.

    The penalty field can be used to give this team a (positive or negative) number of penalty minutes to correct for exceptional circumstances.
team_affiliation

    affilid is the reference ID and name the name of the institution. country should be the 3 character ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 abbreviation of the country and comments is a free form field that is displayed in the jury interface.

    A country flag can be displayed on the scoreboard. For this to work, the country field must match a (flag) picture in www/images/countries/<country>.png. All country flags are present there, named with their 3-character ISO codes. See also www/images/countries/README.
team_category

    categoryid is the reference ID and name is a string: the name of the category. sortorder is the order at which this group must be sorted in the scoreboard, where a higher number sorts lower and equal sort depending on score.

    The color is again a CSS colour specification used to discern different categories easily. See also section Scoreboard: colours.

    The visible flag determines whether teams in this category are displayed on the public/team scoreboard. This feature can be used to remove teams from the public scoreboard by assigning them to a separate, invisible category.
testcase

    The testcase table contains testdata for each problem; testcaseid is a unique identifier, input and output contain the testcase input/output and image an optional graphical representation of the testcase for the jury. The fields md5sum_input, md5sum_output, and md5sum_image contain their respective md5 hashes to check for up-to-date-ness of cached versions by the judgehosts and image_thumb and image_type a thumbnail version and mimetype string for the image. The field probid is the corresponding problem and rank determines the order of the testcases for one problem. description is an optional description for this testcase. See also providing testdata.
user

    This table has the users that the system knows about with their login credentials. Each user may have one or more roles, like being part of a team, being a jury member or administrator. There are also functional accounts, like for judgedaemons.

4.2 Contest milestones

The contest table specifies timestamps for each contest that mark specific milestones in the course of the contest.

The triplet activatetime, starttime and endtime define when the contest runs and are required fields (activatetime and starttime may be equal).

activatetime is the moment when a contest first becomes visible to the public and teams . Nothing can be submitted yet and the problem set is not revealed. Clarifications can be viewed and sent.

At starttime, the scoreboard is displayed and submissions are accepted. At endtime the contest stops. New incoming submissions will still be processed and judged, but the result will not be shown anymore to teams; they instead receive the verdict`too-late'. Unjudged submissions received before endtime will still be judged normally.

freezetime and unfreezetime control scoreboard freezing. freezetime is the time after which the public and team scoreboard are not updated anymore (frozen). This is meant to make the last stages of the contest more thrilling, because no-one knows who has won. Leaving them empty disables this feature. When using this feature, unfreezetime can be set to automatically `unfreeze' the scoreboard at that time. For a more elaborate description, see also section Scoreboard: freezing and defrosting.

The scoreboard, results and clarifications will remain to be displayed to team and public after a contest, until the deactivatetime.

All events happen at the first moment of the defined time. That is: for a contest with starttime "12:00:00" and endtime "17:00:00", the first submission will be accepted at 12:00:00 and the last one at 16:59:59.

The following ordering must always hold: activatetime <= starttime < (freezetime <=) endtime (<= unfreezetime) (<= deactivatime).
4.3 User authentication

The authentication system lets the domserver know which user it is dealing with and which role(s) the user has. This system is modular, allowing flexible addition of new methods, if required. The following methods are available by default for authentication.
PHP session with passwords (default)

Each user receives a password and PHP's session management is used to keep track of which user is logged in. This method is easiest to setup. It does require the administrator to generate users and passwords for all teams (this can be done in the jury interface) and distribute those, though. Also, each team has to login each time they (re)start their browser. The password is stored in a salted MD5 hash in the password field in database (user table).
IP-address based

The IP-address of a team's workstation is used as the primary means of authentication. The system assumes that someone coming from a specific IP is the user with that IP listed in the user table. When a team browses to the web interface, this is checked and the appropriate team page is presented.

This method has the advantage that teams do not have to login. A requirement for this method is that each team computer has a separate IP-address from the view of the domserver, though, so this is most suitable for onsite contests and might not work with online contests if multiple teams are located behind a router, for example.

There are two possible ways of configuring team IP-addresses.
Supply it beforehand

Before the contest starts, when entering teams into the database, add the IP that each team will have to that user's entry in the ip_address field. When the teams arrive, everything will work directly and without further configuration (except when teams switch workplaces). If possible, this is the recommended modus operandi, because it's the least hassle just before and during the contest.
Use one-time passwords

Supply the teams with a one time username and password with which to authenticate. Beforehand, generate passwords for each team in the jury interface. When the test session (or contest) starts and a team connects to the web interface and have an unknown IP, they will be prompted for username and password. Once supplied, the IP is stored and the password is removed and not needed anymore the next time.

This is also a secure option, but requires a bit more hassle from the teams, and maybe from the organisers who have to distribute pieces of paper.

Note: the web interface will only allow a team to authenticate themselves once. If an IP is set, a next authentication will be refused (to avoid trouble with lingering passwords). In order to fully re-authenticate a team, the IP address needs to be unset. You might also want to generate a new password for this specific user. Furthermore, a team must explicitly connect to the team interface URL, because with an unknown IP, the root DOMjudge website will redirect to the public interface.
Using an external LDAP server

This method can be useful when you want to integrate DOMjudge into a larger system, or already have credentials on an LDAP server available. The username field in the database must contain the LDAP username of the DOMjudge user. Furthermore, in etc/domserver-config.php the LDAP_* configuration settings must be adapted to your setup. Note that multiple (backup) servers can be specified: they are queried in order to try to successfully authenticate. After successful authentication against the LDAP server(s), PHP sessions are used to track login into DOMjudge.
Fixed authentication

This method automatically authenticates each connection to the web interface as a fixed, configurable user. This can be useful for testing or demonstration purposes, but probably not for real use scenarios.
Adding new authentication methods

The authentication system is modular and adding new authentication methods is fairly easy. The authentication is handled in the file lib/www/auth.php. Adding a new method amounts to editing the functions in that file to handle your specific case.
4.4 Providing testdata

Testdata is used to judge the problems: when a submission run is given the input testdata, the resulting output is compared to the reference output data using a compare script. The default compare script simply checks if the outputs are equal up to whitespace differences, but more elaborate comparisons can be done, see e.g. the float and boolfind_cmp scripts.

The database has a separate table named testcase, which can be manipulated from the web interface. Under a problem, click on the testcase link. There the files can be uploaded. The judgehosts cache a copy based on MD5 sum, so if you need to make changes later, re-upload the data in the web interface and it will automatically be picked up.

Testdata can also be imported into the system from a problem zip file, following the Kattis problem package format.
4.5 Start the daemons

Once everything is configured, you can start the daemons. They all run as a normal user on the system. The needed root privileges are gained through sudo only when necessary.

    One or more judgedaemons: one on each judgehost (or optionally multiple per host, if cgroups are enabled; then the -n X option should be used to bind a judgedaemon to CPU X to prevent CPU resource conflicts).
    Optionally the balloon notification daemon (as an alternative to the web interface).

4.6 Check that everything works

If the daemons have started without any problems, you've come a long way! Now to check that you're ready for a contest.

First, go to the jury interface: http(s)://yourhost.example.edu/domjudge/jury. Look under all the menu items to see whether the displayed data looks sane. Use the config-checker under `Admin Functions' for some sanity checks on your configuration.

Go to a team workstation and see if you can access the team page and if you can submit solutions.

Next, it is time to submit some test solutions. If you have the default Hello World problem enabled, you can submit some of the example sources from under the doc/examples directory. They should give `CORRECT'.

You can also try some (or all) of the sources under tests. Use make check to submit a variety of tests; this should work when the submit client is available and the default example problems are in the active contest. There's also make stress-test, but be warned that these tests might crash a judgedaemon. The results can be checked in the web interface; each source file specifies the expected outcome with some explanations. For convenience, there is a link judging verifier in the admin web interface; this will automatically check whether submitted sources from the tests directory were judged as expected. Note that a few sources have multiple possible outcomes: these must be verified manually.

When all this worked, you're quite ready for a contest. Or at least, the practice session of a contest.
4.7 Testing jury solutions

Before running a real contest, you and/or the jury will want to test the jury's reference solutions on the system.

The simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a problem zip file and upload this. You can also upload a zip file containing just solutions to an existing problem. Note that the zip archive has to adhere to the Kattis problem package format. For this to work, the jury/admin who uploads the problem has to have an associated team to which the solutions will be assigned. The solutions will automatically be judged if the contest is active (but it need not have started yet). You can verify whether the submissions gave the expected answer from the link on the jury/admin index page.

1. DOMjudge overview

DOMjudge is a system for running programming contests, like the ACM ICPC regional and world championship programming contests.

This means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly 5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 8-11). Problems are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed languages, that reads input according to the problem input specification and writes the correct, corresponding output.

The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to the jury. There the jury system automatically compiles and runs the program and compares the program output with the expected output.

This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during such contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication on problems (clarification requests). It has web interfaces for the jury, the teams (their submissions and clarification requests) and the public (scoreboard).
1.1 Features

About the name and logo

The name of this judging system is inspired by a very important and well known landmark in the city of Utrecht: the dome tower, called the `Dom' in Dutch. The logo of the 2004 Dutch Programming Championships (for which this system was originally developed) depicts a representation of the Dom in zeros and ones. We based the name and logo of DOMjudge on that.

We would like to thank Erik van Sebille, the original creator of the logo. The logo is under a GPL licence, although Erik first suggested a "free as in beer" licence first: you're allowed to use it, but you owe Erik a free beer in case might you encounter him.

3. Before the contest

Before the contest starts, a number of things will need to be configured by the administrator. You can check that information, such as the problem set(s), test data and time limits, contest start- and end time, the time at which the scoreboard will be frozen and unfrozen, all from the links from the front page.

Note that multiple contests can be defined, with corresponding problem sets, for example a practice session and the real contest.
3.1 Problems and languages

The problem sets are listed under `Problems'. It is possible to change whether teams can submit solutions for that problem (using the toggle switch `allow submit'). If disallowed, submissions for that problem will be rejected, but more importantly, teams will not see that problem on the scoreboard. Disallow judge will make DOMjudge accept submissions, but leave them queued; this is useful in case an unexpected problem shows up with one of the problems. Timelimit is the maximum number of seconds a submission for this problem is allowed to run before a `TIMELIMIT' response is given (to be multiplied possibly by a language factor). Note that a `timelimit overshoot' can be configured to let submissions run a bit longer. Although DOMjudge will use the actual limit to determine the verdict, this allows judges to see if a submission is close to the timelimit.

Problems can be imported and exported into and from DOMjudge using zip-files that contain the problem metadata and testdata files, based on the problemarchive.org format. See appendix Problem package format -specification for details. Problems can have special compare and run scripts associated to them, to deal with problem statements that require non-standard evaluation. For more details see the administrator's manual.

The `Languages' overview is quite the same. It has a timefactor column; submissions in a language that has time factor 2 will be allowed to run twice the time that has been specified under Problems. This can be used to compensate for the execution speed of a language, e.g. Java.
3.2 Verifying testdata

For checking whether the your testdata conforms to the specifications of your problem statement, we recommend the checktestdata program, which is available from a separate repository. It allows you to not only check on simple (spacing) layout errors, but a simple grammar file must be specified for the testdata, according to which the testdata is checked. This allows e.g. for bounds checking.

This program is built upon the separate library libchecktestdata.h that can be used to write the syntax checking part of special compare scripts: it can easily handle the tedious task of verifying that a team's submission output is syntactically valid, leaving just the task of semantic validation to another program.
3.3 Testing jury solutions

Before a contest, you will want to have tested your reference solutions on the system to see whether those are judged as expected and maybe use their runtimes to set timelimits for the problems.

The simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a problem zip file and upload this. You can also upload a zip file containing just solutions to an existing problem. Note that the zip archive has to adhere to the Kattis problem package format. For this to work, the jury/admin who uploads the problem has to have an associated team to which the solutions will be assigned. The solutions will automatically be judged if the contest is active (but it need not have started yet). You can verify whether the submissions gave the expected answer from the link on the jury/admin index page.
3.4 Practice Session

If your contest has a test session or practice contest, use it also as a general rehearsal of the jury system: judge test submissions as you would do during the real contest and answer incoming clarification requests.
