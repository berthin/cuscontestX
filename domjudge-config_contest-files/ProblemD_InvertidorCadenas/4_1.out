Almost all tables have an identifier most of these are numeric and automatically these do not need to be the tables executable and language have text strings as identifier these need to be manually specified and only dash and underscore characters are configuration this table contains configuration these entries are simply stored as value where the values are json type contains the allowed data and description documents the configuration contest the contests that the software will a test session and the live cid is the reference id and contestname is a descriptive.
Name used in the while shortname is the publicly visible starttime and endtime are required fields and specify when this contest is active and open for optional freezetime and unfreezetime control scoreboard freezing and deactivatetime when the contest is not visible for a detailed treating of see section contest all contest times can be specified relative to except of course starttime the input given in the jury interface relative or is stored in the while a calculated absolute version is stored in the fields without the the public field can be used to limit which contests are displayed as public scoreboards opposed to privately to a selected set of while enabled can be.
Used to disable a contest contestproblem this table couples problems to cid and probid describe the it stores problem data that is specific for the included shortname is a identifier string for the points defaults to and can be set to assign determines whether teams can submit solutions for this problems are also.
Not displayed on the this can be used to define spare which can then be added to the contest determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this see also the explanation for the color tag can be filled with a css colour specification to.
Associate with this see also section contestteam this table couples teams to teams can only submit solutions to problems in contests that are public or which they are part executable this table stores of executable scripts that can be used as and compare this table encodes restriction sets for selecting which submissions are sent.
To a the restrictions are json encoded in the restrictions and can be set in the admin web interface to restrict on specific and to never rejudge on the same a restriction set can be assigned to on the edit page of the judgehosts language programming languages in which to accept and judge langid is a string of maximum length which references the name is the displayed name of the extensions is a json encoded list of recognized.
Filename determines whether teams can submit using this determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this this can for example be set to no to temporarily hold judging when a problem occurs with the judging of a specific after resolution of the problem this can be set to yes is the relative factor by which the timelimit is multiplied for solutions in this refers to a compile executable script that is used for this.
Problem this table contains the problem probid is the reference cid is the contest id this problem is defined a problem cannot be used in multiple name is the full name of the determines whether teams can submit solutions for this problems are also not displayed on the this can be used to define spare which can then be added to the contest determines whether judgehosts will judge submissions for this see also the explanation for timelimit is the timelimit in seconds within which solutions for this problem have to run into account per see also enforcement of time.
Limits for more memlimit is the memory limit in kb allotted for this if empty then the global configuration setting is equivalently for if not empty defines a custom run program to run compiled submissions for this problem and if not empty defines a custom compare program to compare output for this the color tag can be filled with a css colour specification to associate with this see also section in problemtext a html or plain text document can be placed which allows public and jury to download the problem note.
That no additional filtering takes so html pdf to some should be from a trusted source to prevent cross site scripting or other the file type is stored in team table of teamid is id of the while externalid can be used to store an id for to other name the displayed name of the categoryid is the id of the category the team is affilid is the affiliation id of the when enabled is set to the team immediately disappears from the scoreboards and cannot use the team web interface even when already logged one use case could be to disqualify a team on the members are the names of the team separated by newlines and room is the location or room.
Of the both for display comments can be filled with arbitrary useful information and is only visible to the the timestamp and the hostname field indicate where a team visited its team web the penalty field can be used to give this team a or number of penalty minutes to correct for exceptional affilid is the reference id and name the name of the country should be the character iso abbreviation of the country and comments is a free form field that is displayed in the jury a country flag can be displayed on the for this to the country field must match a picture in all country flags are present named with their iso see also categoryid is the reference id and.
Name is a the name of the sortorder is the order at which this group must be sorted in.
The where a higher number sorts lower and equal sort depending on the color is again a css colour specification used to discern different categories see also section the visible flag determines whether teams in this category are displayed on the this feature can be used to remove teams from the public scoreboard by assigning them to a invisible testcase the testcase table contains testdata for each testcaseid is a unique input and output contain the testcase and image an optional graphical representation of the.
Testcase for the the fields and contain their respective hashes to check for of cached versions by the judgehosts.
And and a thumbnail version and mimetype string for the the field probid is the corresponding problem and rank determines the order of the testcases for one description is an optional description for this see also providing user this table has the users that the system knows about with their login each user may have one or more like being part of a being a jury member or there are also functional like for contest milestones the contest table specifies timestamps for each contest that mark specific milestones in the course of the.
The triplet starttime and endtime define when the contest runs and are required fields and starttime may be activatetime is the moment when a contest first becomes visible to the public and teams nothing can be submitted yet and the problem set is not clarifications can be viewed and at the scoreboard is displayed and submissions are at endtime the contest new incoming submissions will still be processed and but the result will not be shown anymore to they instead receive the unjudged submissions received before endtime will still be judged freezetime and unfreezetime control scoreboard freezetime is the time after which the public and team scoreboard are not updated anymore this is meant to make the last stages of the contest more because knows who has leaving them empty disables this when using this unfreezetime can be set to automatically the scoreboard at that for a more elaborate see.
Also section freezing and the results and clarifications will remain to be displayed to team and public after a until the all events happen at the first moment of the defined that for a contest with starttime and endtime the first submission will be accepted at and the last one at the following ordering must always activatetime starttime endtime user authentication the authentication system lets the domserver know which user it is dealing with and which the user this system is allowing flexible addition of new if the following methods are available by default for.
Php session with passwords each user receives a password and session management is used to keep track of which user is logged this method is easiest to it does require the administrator to generate users and passwords for all teams can be done in the jury and distribute each team has to login each time they their the password is stored in a salted hash in the password field in database based the of a workstation is used as the primary means of the system assumes that someone coming from a specific ip is the user with that.
Ip.
Listed in the user when a team browses to the web this is checked and the appropriate team page is this method has the advantage that teams do not have to a requirement for this method is that each team computer has a separate from the view of the so this is most suitable for onsite contests and might not work with online contests if multiple teams are located behind a for there are two possible ways of configuring team supply it beforehand before the contest when entering teams into the.
Add the ip that each team will have to that entry in the when the teams everything will work directly and without further configuration when teams switch if this is the recommended modus because the least hassle just before and during the use passwords supply the teams with a one time username and password with which to generate passwords for each team in the jury when the test session starts and a team connects to the web interface and have an unknown they will be prompted for username and once the ip is stored and the password is removed and not needed anymore the next this is also a secure but requires a bit more.
Hassle from the and maybe from the organisers who have to distribute pieces of the web interface will only allow a.
Team to authenticate themselves if an ip is a next authentication will be refused avoid trouble with lingering in order to fully a the ip address needs to be you might also want to generate a new password for this specific a team must explicitly connect to the team interface because with an unknown the root domjudge website will redirect to the public using an external ldap server this method can be useful when you want to integrate domjudge into a larger or already have credentials on an ldap server the username field in the database must contain the ldap username of the domjudge in the configuration settings must be adapted to your note that multiple servers can.
Be they are queried in order to try to successfully after successful authentication against the ldap php sessions are used to track login into fixed authentication this method automatically authenticates each connection to the web interface as a configurable this can be useful for testing or demonstration but probably not for real use adding.
New authentication methods the authentication system is modular and adding new authentication methods is fairly the authentication is handled in the file adding a new method amounts to editing the functions in that file to handle your specific providing testdata testdata is used to judge the when a submission run is given the input the resulting output is compared to the reference output data using a compare the default compare script simply checks if the outputs are equal up to whitespace but more elaborate comparisons can be see the float and the database has a separate table named which can be manipulated from the web under a click on the testcase there the files can be the judgehosts cache a copy based on so if you need to make changes the data.
In the web interface and it will automatically be picked testdata can also be imported into the system from a problem zip.
Following the kattis problem package start the daemons once everything is you can start the they all run as a normal user on the the needed root privileges are gained through sudo only when one or more one on each judgehost optionally multiple per if cgroups are then the x option should be used to bind a judgedaemon to cpu x to prevent cpu resource optionally the balloon notification daemon an alternative to the web check that everything works if the daemons have started without any come a long now to check that ready for a go to the jury look under all the menu items to see whether the displayed data looks use the under for some sanity checks on your go to a team workstation and see if you can access.
The team page and if you can submit it is time to submit some test if you have the default hello world problem you can submit some of the example sources from under the they should give you can also try some of the sources under use make check to submit a variety of this should work when the submit client is available and the default example problems are in the active also make but be warned that these tests might crash a the results can be checked in the web each source file specifies the expected outcome with some for there is a link judging verifier in the admin web this will automatically check whether submitted sources from the tests directory were judged as note that.
A few sources have multiple possible these must be verified when all this quite ready for a.
Or at the practice session of a testing jury solutions before running a real you the jury will want to test the reference solutions on the the simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a problem zip file and upload you.
Can also upload a zip file containing just solutions to an existing note that the zip archive has to adhere to the kattis problem package for this to the who uploads the problem has to have an associated team to which the solutions will be the solutions will automatically be judged if the contest is active it need not have started you can verify whether the submissions gave the expected answer from the link on the index next previous contents next previous contents domjudge overview domjudge is a system for running programming like the acm icpc regional and world championship programming this means that teams are and have a fixed time period and one computer to solve a number of problems problems are solved by writing a program in.
One of the allowed that reads input according to the problem input specification and writes the corresponding the judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to the there the jury system automatically compiles and runs the program and compares the program output with the expected this software can be used to handle the submission and judging during such it also handles feedback to the.

Switch if submissions for that problem will be but more teams will not see that problem on the disallow judge will make domjudge accept but leave them this is useful in case an unexpected problem shows up with one of the timelimit is the maximum number of seconds a submission for this problem is allowed to run before a response is given be multiplied possibly by a language note that a can be configured to let submissions run a bit although domjudge will use the actual limit to determine the this allows judges to see if.
A submission is close to the problems can be imported and exported into and from domjudge.

Of verifying that a.
Submission output is syntactically leaving just the task of semantic validation to another testing jury solutions before a you will want to have tested your reference solutions on the system to see whether those are judged as expected and maybe use their runtimes to set timelimits for the the simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a problem zip file and upload you can also upload a zip file containing just.
